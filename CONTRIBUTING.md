# Contributing to hacktoberfest-2020 (this repo)

🎉 First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Creating a Pull Request

### We are currently accepting pull requests on `hackbar`.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. You should test the code you've added.
1. Ensure that changes aligns with the community guideline and [doucumentation](README.md)
1. Don't just open pull requests with minor text edits
1. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
